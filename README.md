# volto-modal-block

A Volto block that provides a modal dialog. The trigger button for the modal can be configured with an icon and title text.

## Features

- **Configurable Trigger Button:** Customize the appearance of the button that opens the modal by setting an icon and title text.
- **Embed Any Volto Blocks:** The content of the modal is highly flexible. You can add and arrange any other Volto blocks (text, images, videos, grids, etc.) directly within the modal.

## How to Use

1.  Add the "Modal Button" block to your page.
2.  In the block settings (usually in the sidebar), configure the "Icon" and "Title" for the button that will trigger the modal.
3.  In the main block editing area for the Modal Button block, you will see a section labeled "Modal Content" (or similar, based on the schema title for `modalBlocks`).
4.  Add any Volto blocks you want to display inside the modal into this "Modal Content" area.
5.  Save the page. Clicking the configured button will now open a modal displaying the blocks you added.
